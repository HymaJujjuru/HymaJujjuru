Bio: <br/>
Hi, Iâ€™m Hyma Jujjuru, a computer science major with a minor in mathematics and business at the University of Colorado Boulder. I have a deep interest in machine learning, robotics, and deep reinforcement learning. I am doing research in the Human Interaction Robotics Lab in Boulder, CO, where I integrate tools like Whisper, Ollama, and Hugging Face Transformers for real-time speech-to-text and prompt engineering using Llama models. I also work with PyTorch and deep reinforcement learning to push the boundaries of human-robot interaction.


Outside of research, Iâ€™m a driven leader and active community member. I serve as Professional Relations Director for Tau Beta Pi, organizing events like resume workshops and mock interviews, and Iâ€™m also on the board of the Engineering Excellence Fund, where I help allocate resources to impactful engineering projects. Whether Iâ€™m coding, planning events, or diving into market data, I bring curiosity, clarity, and a love for creating meaningful experiences.


When Iâ€™m not in the lab or in meetings, youâ€™ll probably find me cooking with my mom, baking something sweet, or exploring the city of Boulder.
